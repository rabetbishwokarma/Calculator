# Calculator
This is a simple calculator program that allows you to perform various operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulo. The program prompts the user to select an operation and input the required numbers, and then it performs the calculation using the `operations` module.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation and input the numbers.

5. The program will perform the calculation and display the result.

## Operations

The calculator supports the following operations:

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers together.
- **Modulo**: Calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another.

## Dependencies

The calculator relies on the `operations` module to perform the calculations. Make sure you have the `operations.py` file in the same directory as the `calculator.py` file.
